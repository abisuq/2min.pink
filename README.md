2 minute challenge to raise smartphone overuse awareness

## About
This project objective is two raise awareness of how smartphones are highjacking our attention.
Smartphones are helpful and can be used to improve a lot of lives yet so many applications profit from our attention.
The most talented pool of people in the world are constantly tweaking these applications to make them more and more addictive.

If this project changes one, and one only, life I will be fulfilled. Even if it does not I am doing it to also learn and train my work methodologies that got damaged, over the last years, by these devices (smartphones and computers as well).

## Technical requirements
